# Introduction to Japanese Learning Journey

Learning Japanese is difficult, and sometimes very challenging for some of us,
especially those who come from a language written in the Latin alphabet.
I come from one of those languages myself. I am from Turkey, and my native
language is Turkish, which is also written in the Latin alphabet.

After this brief introduction, I would like to explain my purpose in writing
this book (or diary, however you like to call it).
I've always wanted to learn Japanese, but I've always struggled with it.
This time it's different. This time I will succeed.
