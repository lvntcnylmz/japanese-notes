# Kanji

Kanji is said to be the most difficult part of learning Japanese. The most common reasons for this are "there are a lot of them," or "they are complicated," or even "they are hard."
Kanji (漢字) are single words, made of radicals. There's over 5,000 of them, but most of them are only used in people's names. You only need to know around 2,000 to read a newspaper.

## Radicals

Radicals are the building blocks of kanji.
Bushu (部首) are the smallest units (we call them "radicals"). They are like letters of the alphabet, but there's over 200 of them. Just like English letters, radicals don't have any real meaning. And again, just like English, radicals are combined in largely random combinations to make kanji.
